# Coffee and Wifi
This is a coffee shop finder website. The backend work is done with python, flask-wtf-forms and bootstrap-wtf-forms. By clicking the "show me" in the home page you can see the shops available with many other details associated with them. If you go to the "/add" route, then you can add coffee shops.

You should be very clear that this will run only locally, you need to run the main.py folder, then flask will give you one link and the website will be locally available in that link.
